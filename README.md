# MLB-Predictors-Hub
****

MLB Predictors Hub is a personal project that was created to gain experience making a website using ReactJS and practice creating Machine Learning models using various libraries and techniques. An overview of the data can be seen below, along with descriptions of the website and the models created.

## Data Overview
****
The dataset being used is [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](!http://seanlahman.com/download-baseball-database/), which has "complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2022, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more." The data is separated into different csv files, so there will be a good amount of preprocessing for every task, based on what information is necessary. What is deemed "necessary" for each task was determined based on my understanding of baseball and research into the topic. The tasks will be discussed below, and they have various applications including medical, on-field performance, and sports gambling.
